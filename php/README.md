Getting started with PHP and SFTP to Go
======================================

The code in this directory contains sample code in PHP, that accompanies the tutorial that can be found [here](https://sftptogo.com/blog/php-sftp?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github).

This example requires the SSH2 PHP extension which can be installed using [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/package/ssh2).
